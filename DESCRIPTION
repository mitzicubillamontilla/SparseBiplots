Description: The 'HJ-Biplot' is a multivariate method that represents high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional subspace, capturing most of the information’s variability in just a few dimensions. This package implements three new regularized versions of the HJ-Biplot: Ridge, LASSO, and Elastic Net. These versions introduce restrictions that shrink or zero-out variable weights to improve interpretability based on regularization theory. All methods provide graphical representations using 'ggplot2'.
