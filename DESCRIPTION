Description: The sparseHJBiplot package contains a set of functions that allow to represent multivariate on a subspace of low dimension, in such a way that most of the variability of the information is captured. This representation is carried out through the HJ Biplot methodology. A first method performs Galindo's HJ-Biplot (1986). Then, the package implements three new techniques and constructs in each case the HJ Biplot, adapting restrictions to contract and / or produce zero charges in the main components, based on the regularization theories. It implements three methods of regularization: Ridge, LASSO and Elastic Net. The functions are as follows: Ridge_HJBiplot, Lasso_HJBiplot and ElasticNet_HJBiplot.
